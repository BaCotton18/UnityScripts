# UnityScripts
Unity scripts that I made for my VR Project.
PlayMyAnimation will check to see if anything that enters the trigger is a player. If so, it will trigger an animation and have that animation play for as long as the player is in the trigger.

HoldAnimation is a modified version of PlayMyAnimation which checks for an object instead of the player.

textChange checks for an object. If an object is found, then it gives a description of the object.

SelfDestruct will destroy the trigger after the player enters it. If you're using it for animations, it is recommended that you make sure that "Has end animation" is disabled.
